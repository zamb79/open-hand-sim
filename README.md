# open-hand-sim

This project aims at the development of a realistic 3d hand model including kinematics. Our main intention is to 
use this hand model in oder to generate artificial data to train a neural network to learn hand poses in 3d. However, 
the model may be freely used and could be useful for other applications as well. You may use the plain 3d surface
model which is available as [.ply file here](../../raw/master/hand.ply)

This project provides two important things:
1) A 3d model (including kinematics/bones) of the human hand as Blender file
2) Python scripts to control the human hand and integrate the model with pytorch
